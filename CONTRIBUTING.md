We welcome contributions to this curated list! Your help is essential in making this a comprehensive resource for the intersection of neuroscience, memory, and artificial intelligence.

## Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines when submitting a pull request:

1.  **Scope:** Ensure the resource is directly relevant to **Artificial Memory (AM)**, the **Neuroscience of Forgetting**, or the application of forgetting mechanisms (like selective pruning, memory compression, or continual learning) in AI systems.

    ```markdown
    *   **[Type] Title** [Source URL]
        *   *Focus:* A brief, one-sentence description of the resource's main topic or relevance to Artificial Memory.
    ```
    *   **Type** should be one of: `[Paper]`, `[Article]`, `[Book]`, `[Tool]`, `[Project]`, `[Video]`.
3.  **Categorization:** Place your entry under the most appropriate existing category in the `README.md`. If a new category is needed, please propose it in your pull request description.
4.  **No Duplicates:** Check the existing list to ensure the resource is not already included.
