<h1 align="center"> Awesome Artificial Memory<p align="center"> </h1

A curated list of resources, research papers, and projects exploring the concept of **Artificial Memory** (AM), with a special focus on the **Neuroscience of Forgetting** and its application to intelligent systems.

## 💡 The Core Idea: Forgetting as a feature and memory can be manipulated

Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) focuses on maximizing information retention. However, human intelligence is fundamentally linked to the ability to **selectively forget**. In the context of ever-growing data, Artificial Memory (AM) seeks to move beyond mere data storage to a system that actively manages, prioritizes, and prunes information to maintain adaptability, efficiency, and relevance.

> "The purpose of memory is not to store the past, but to anticipate the future." - **The ability to forget is not a bug, but a feature** that enhances cognitive function and adaptability.

## 🧠 Neuroscience of Memory and Forgetting

Resources detailing the biological and psychological mechanisms of memory consolidation and active forgetting.

### Forgetting as an Active Process

*   **[Paper] The Biology of Forgetting – A Perspective** [1]
    *   *Focus:* Discusses active forgetting mechanisms, including neurogenesis-based forgetting, interference-based forgetting, and intrinsic forgetting.
*   **[Article] Not a Flaw, But a Brain's Hidden Feature of Memory** [2]
    *   *Focus:* Explores how forgetting irrelevant memories fosters adaptability and better decision-making in shifting environments.
*   **[Article] Why Forgetting is Good for Your Memory** [3]
    *   *Focus:* Explains the cognitive benefits of forgetting, such as prioritizing information, improving decision-making, and enhancing creativity.

### Computational Neuroscience Models

*   **[Paper] Computational model reveals how the brain manages short-term memories** [11]
    *   *Focus:* A computational model showing how the brain maintains short-term information using specific types of neurons, suggesting a mechanism for selective retention.
*   **[Paper] Forgetting Enhances Episodic Control With Structured Representations** [12]
    *   *Focus:* Computational study demonstrating that forgetting can benefit the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents by preventing over-reliance on outdated state information.
*   **[Paper] Retroactive interference model of forgetting** [13]
    *   *Focus:* Mathematical model proposing that memory can be erased due to subsequently acquired memories (retroactive interference), a key mechanism for active pruning.

### Memory Consolidation and Trace

*   **[Paper] The seven sins of memory: insights from psychology and cognitive neuroscience** [4]
    *   *Focus:* A classic paper by Daniel Schacter that frames memory failures (including forgetting) as byproducts of otherwise adaptive features of memory.


## 🛠️ Tools and Frameworks (Memory Infrastructure)

Tools that provide fine-grained control over memory, which is essential for implementing selective forgetting.

*   **[Project]** [mem0ai/mem0 - GitHub](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)
    *   *Focus:* Universal memory layer for LLM applications. Focuses on memory compression and context optimization, which is a form of functional forgetting.
*   **[Project]** [getzep/zep - GitHub](https://github.com/getzep/zep)
    *   *Focus:* Context Engineering Platform for AI Agents. Provides structured memory (Facts, Entities) and fine-grained API control, enabling selective deletion based on metadata.
