<h1 align="center"> Awesome Artificial Memory<p align="center"> </h1

A curated list of resources, research papers, and projects exploring the concept of **Artificial Memory** (AM), with a special focus on the **Neuroscience of Forgetting** and its application to intelligent systems.

## 💡 The Core Idea: Forgetting as a feature and memory can be manipulated

Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) focuses on maximizing information retention. However, human intelligence is fundamentally linked to the ability to **selectively forget**. In the context of ever-growing data, Artificial Memory (AM) seeks to move beyond mere data storage to a system that actively manages, prioritizes, and prunes information to maintain adaptability, efficiency, and relevance.

> "The purpose of memory is not to store the past, but to anticipate the future." - **The ability to forget is not a bug, but a feature** that enhances cognitive function and adaptability.

## 🧠 Neuroscience of Memory and Forgetting

Resources detailing the biological and psychological mechanisms of memory consolidation and active forgetting.

*   **[Book]** [Elizabeth A. Kensinger: Why We Forget and How to Remember Better: The Science Behind Memory](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/bcnews/science-tech-and-health/psychology/the-science-behind-memory.html)
    *   Memory is an active and cyclical process, analogous to building a structure out of blocks.
    *   In this way, memory is a continually changing representation; it is not a static representation of the past.



## 🛠️ Tools and Frameworks (Memory Infrastructure)

Tools that provide fine-grained control over memory, which is essential for implementing selective forgetting.
